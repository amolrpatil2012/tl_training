Foreach loop - IsAnyWordLongerThan
Using the foreach loop, implement the IsAnyWordLongerThan method, which given a length and an array of words, returns true if any of those words is longer than the given length, and false otherwise.



For example:

for length 4 and words {"aaa", "bbbb", "ccccc"} the result shall be true, because "ccccc" is longer than 4 letters

for length 5 and words {"aaa", "bbbb", "ccccc"} the result shall be false because no word is longer than 5 letters

for length 5 and an empty array, the result shall be false because no word is longer than 5 letters
